## About Code
Collaborative Research of Doosan&CAU

You have to modify `config.py`to select mode as Auto-Encoder or WDCNN
### 1. Environment setup
This code has been tested on 
- Window10 Python 3.8.3, Pytorch 1.7.1 (main)
- Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8.3, Pytorch 0.7.0/1.6.0, CUDA 10.2.

Please install related libraries before running this code: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note** Also check your data-path in `config.py` 

### 2. Test & Evaluation
Download pretrained model: [general_model](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QeU7OcTqHksZXscBq3skiw)(code: c99t) and put it into `tools/snapshot` directory.

Download testing datasets and put them into `test_dataset` directory. If you want to test the tracker on a new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit) to set test_dataset.

```bash 
python test.py                                
	--dataset A                 #dataset_name
	--snapshot snapshot/general_model.pth  # tracker_name
```
The testing result will be saved in the `results/dataset_name/tracker_name` directory.

### 3. Train
